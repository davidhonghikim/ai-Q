```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Real Recipe Tests
```bash
cd temp_kitchen_testing
python run_real_recipe_tests.py

### 2. Manual Testing
- Load and examine real recipes in recipes/ directory
- Test kitchen-pantry integration
- Execute recipe steps manually
- Validate outputs and error handling

### 3. Cleanup
```bash
cd temp_kitchen_testing
python cleanup_testing.py
```
