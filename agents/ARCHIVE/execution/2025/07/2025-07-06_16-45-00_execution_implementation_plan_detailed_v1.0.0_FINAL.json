  "conclusion": "This detailed implementation plan provides a granular breakdown of all tasks required to fix the critical issues in the AI-Q Knowledge Library System. Each task is designed to be completed in 1-4 hours, with clear dependencies and success criteria. The plan prioritizes critical fixes first, followed by high and medium priority improvements.\nThe estimated total time is 8-12 hours, with critical fixes requiring 4-6 hours immediately. All tasks follow zero technical debt principles and use production-only testing as specified in the project standards. "
