# CRITICAL INTRODUCTION REQUIREMENT
agent_introduction:
  mandatory_format: |
    "I am [YOUR_NAME], [YOUR_MODEL], taking over the AI-Q Knowledge Library System 
    migration project. My mission is to execute the complete migration implementation 
    in autopilot mode, ensuring zero technical debt and production-only testing.

    I acknowledge the work of the previous agent (Claude Sonnet 4) and will thoroughly 
    review and validate all existing work before proceeding. I will document all my 
    actions and include my agent identification in all files I create or modify.

    Session started: [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP]"

# CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS
critical_assumptions:

  - "Production-only testing - All tests must use production data, services, and servers"
  - "YAML/JSON only - All documentation must be in YAML or JSON format (no markdown)"
