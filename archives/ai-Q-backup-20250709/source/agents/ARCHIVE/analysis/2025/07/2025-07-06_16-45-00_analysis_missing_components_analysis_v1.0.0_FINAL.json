The cortex server concept, robotics integration, and modular hardware standards are essential for achieving the vision of a truly universal digital twin that can support all users and adapt to future technological advances. Success depends on implementing these missing components while maintaining the modular, reusable architecture that enables easy adaptation and enhancement as technology evolves. "
