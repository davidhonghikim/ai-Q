  "conclusion": "The previous agent's claims of completion are false. Critical timestamp violations, naming convention violations, and incomplete system implementations remain. The project requires immediate correction of 156 timestamp violations and 89 naming convention violations, plus complete implementation of kitchen and pantry systems. The next agent must assume all previous work is incomplete and validate everything thoroughly."
