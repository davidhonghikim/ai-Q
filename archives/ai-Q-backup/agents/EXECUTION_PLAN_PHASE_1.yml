  Phase 1 execution plan for AI-Q Knowledge Library System migration,
  focusing on environment setup and critical issue resolution.

# PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES

    - "TypeScript compiler available"
  documentation:
    - "Document Node.js installation process"
    - "Record versions installed"

    - "pip install --upgrade pip"
    - "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  validation:
    - "Virtual environment created successfully"
    - "All dependencies installed without errors"
    - "Environment activation works"
  documentation:
    - "Document virtual environment setup"
    - "Record installed package versions"
    - "Create troubleshooting guide"

## STEP 3: FIX CONFIGURATION INTERFACE MISMATCH
step_3_configuration_fix:
  objective: "Unify EnvironmentConfig interface across all files"
  actions:
    - "Review current interface definitions in types.ts"
    - "Review interface usage in env-parser.ts"
    - "Review interface usage in file-loader.ts"
    - "Identify inconsistencies and conflicts"
    - "Create unified interface definition"
    - "Update all files to use consistent interface"
  validation:
    - "All TypeScript compilation errors resolved"
    - "Interface consistency verified across all files"
    - "Type safety restored"
  documentation:
    - "Document interface changes made"
    - "Create interface documentation"
    - "Update type definitions guide"

## STEP 4: VALIDATE EXISTING CONFIGURATIONS
step_4_configuration_validation:
  objective: "Validate all existing configuration files and schemas"
  actions:
    - "Validate environment-template.json against schema"
    - "Validate env-schema.json structure"
    - "Test configuration loading in file-loader.ts"
    - "Test environment parsing in env-parser.ts"
    - "Verify all configuration paths and references"
  validation:
    - "All configuration files load without errors"
    - "Schema validation passes"
    - "Configuration parsing works correctly"
  documentation:
    - "Create configuration validation report"
    - "Document any issues found and resolved"
    - "Update configuration documentation"

## STEP 5: SET UP DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE
step_5_development_infrastructure:
  objective: "Set up complete development infrastructure"
  actions:
    - "Configure TypeScript compilation"
    - "Set up linting and formatting tools"
    - "Configure testing framework"
    - "Set up build process"
    - "Configure development scripts"
  validation:
    - "TypeScript compilation works"
    - "Linting and formatting tools functional"
    - "Testing framework operational"
    - "Build process successful"
  documentation:
    - "Document development setup process"
    - "Create development workflow guide"
    - "Update package.json scripts"

# SUCCESS CRITERIA
success_criteria:

# CONCLUSION
conclusion: >
  Phase 1 focuses on establishing a solid foundation by resolving critical issues
  and setting up a complete development environment. Success in this phase is
  essential for the successful implementation of the AI-Q Knowledge Library System
  in subsequent phases. All work must follow zero technical debt principles and
  use production-only testing as specified in the project standards.
