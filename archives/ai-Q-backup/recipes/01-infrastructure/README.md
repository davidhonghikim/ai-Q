# Infrastructure Foundation Recipes

Complete infrastructure setup for Universal Digital Twin system with 45 detailed tasks (87,500 tokens total).

## Overview

Establishes production-ready containerized environment with:
- **Core Services**: PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7, Minio S3, Weaviate vector DB
- **AI Processing**: Sentence Transformers, CLIP multi-modal models
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, AlertManager
- **Logging**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Security**: SSL/TLS, network isolation, secrets management

## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-12) - 90 min
System verification, Docker setup, service deployment, basic configuration

### Phase 2: Automation (Tasks 13-24) - 90 min  
Security hardening, performance tuning, monitoring setup, backup strategies

### Phase 3: Operations (Tasks 25-36) - 90 min
CI/CD foundation, operational procedures, maintenance automation

### Phase 4: Validation (Tasks 37-45) - 60 min
Testing, auditing, documentation, handoff preparation

## Available Tasks

- `task-001.json` - System Verification & Docker Optimization (1800 tokens)
- `task-002.json` - Project Structure & Git Repository Setup (1900 tokens)  
- `task-003.json` - Docker Compose Infrastructure Definition (1950 tokens)
- `task-004.json` - Infrastructure Deployment & Health Verification (1800 tokens)
- `RECIPE-OVERVIEW.json` - Complete task list and execution plan

## Task Structure
Each task (1500-2000 tokens) includes:
- Detailed objectives and execution steps
- Platform-specific commands
- Comprehensive troubleshooting
- Validation criteria and success metrics

## Performance Targets

- **Startup**: < 5 minutes complete deployment
- **Memory**: < 8GB total services
- **CPU**: < 20% idle, < 80% load
- **Storage**: < 15GB initial footprint
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime

## Service URLs (Post-Deployment)

- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- Redis: localhost:6379
- Minio API/Console: localhost:9000/9001
- Weaviate: localhost:8080
- Grafana: localhost:3001
- Prometheus: localhost:9090
- Elasticsearch: localhost:9200
- Kibana: localhost:5601

## Prerequisites

- 32GB+ RAM, 8+ CPU cores, 500GB+ storage
- Docker 24.0+, Compose V2 2.15+, Git 2.35+
- Administrative privileges, internet connectivity

## Quick Start

1. Review `RECIPE-OVERVIEW.json` for complete execution plan
2. Execute tasks sequentially starting with `task-001.json`
3. Validate each task with included verification commands
4. Monitor deployment with health checks and metrics

## Success Criteria

✅ All 12+ services healthy and responding  
✅ Performance targets met or exceeded  
✅ Security policies enforced, vulnerabilities addressed  
✅ Complete monitoring and alerting operational  
✅ Documentation complete, infrastructure ready for development
