## MISSION BRIEF
Complete the systematic timestamp violation correction process for the ai-Q project. All files with January 2025 timestamps must be updated to reflect actual file creation/modification times from July 2025.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
- Previous agent corrected 33+ files but work is incomplete
- User requested handoff due to perceived deviation from proper execution standards
- Quality over speed approach required - each file must be individually validated
- All timestamps must use actual file properties, not arbitrary dates

## WORK COMPLETED (33+ files)
### Phase 1: Critical Files (8 files)
- ai-Q/README.json, docker/DOCKER_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.json, docker/compose/docker-compose.json
- prompts/agents/agent_workflow.json, prompts/system/core_rules.json
- manual/README.json, recipes/00-RECIPE_INDEX.json
- recipes/17-deployment-automation/01-deployment-automation-recipe.json

### Phase 2-8: Recipe Files (25+ files)
- recipes/16-scaling-optimization/, recipes/15-backup-recovery/, recipes/14-monitoring-alerting/
- recipes/11-quality-assurance/, recipes/13-deployment/, recipes/12-advanced-interfaces/
- recipes/10-interface/, recipes/09-knowledge-synthesis/, recipes/08-research-automation/
- recipes/07-content-creation-workflows/, recipes/06-content-processing/
- recipes/04-ai-agent-integration/, recipes/03-intelligence/, recipes/02-ai-services/
- recipes/01-infrastructure/README.json

## WORK REMAINING (PRIORITY ORDER)

### 1. CRITICAL: Complete recipes/01-infrastructure/ subdirectories
**MANDATORY - Process these first:**
```
recipes/01-infrastructure/01-core-infrastructure/
recipes/01-infrastructure/02-docker-unified-infrastructure/
recipes/01-infrastructure/03-storage-systems/
recipes/01-infrastructure/04-database-setup/
recipes/01-infrastructure/05-monitoring-observability/
recipes/01-infrastructure/06-creative-and-automation-services/
recipes/01-infrastructure/07-persistent-data-volumes/
recipes/01-infrastructure/REFERENCE_MONOLITHIC/
```

### 2. HIGH: Process remaining recipe directories
```
recipes/kitchen/
recipes/pantry/
recipes/examples/
```

### 3. MEDIUM: Scan for any missed files
- Any JSON files in other project directories
- Configuration files
- Documentation files
- Any files with timestamp fields

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Systematic Directory Processing
For each directory:
1. `ls recipes/[directory]/` - List all files
2. For each JSON file found:
   - `Get-ItemProperty "path/to/file.json"` - Get actual file properties
   - Read file to identify timestamp fields
   - Update all timestamp fields to match actual file modification time
   - Use search_replace tool for precise corrections

### Step 2: Quality Validation
- Each file must be individually validated
- All timestamp fields must be corrected (creation_date, last_updated, etc.)
- Some files may have duplicate timestamp fields requiring multiple corrections

### Step 3: Commit and Push Cycle
- Commit after each logical batch with detailed notes
- Push to remote repository
- Include specific file paths and timestamps in commit messages

### Step 4: Final Verification
- Double-check for any missed files or directories
- Ensure all timestamp violations are resolved
- Verify no January 2025 timestamps remain

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Timestamp Format
- Use ISO 8601 format: "2025-07-06T16:10:00Z"
- Convert from file modification time (LastWriteTime)
- Example: `Get-ItemProperty "file.json"` shows "7/6/2025 4:10 PM" â†’ "2025-07-06T16:10:00Z"

### Common Timestamp Fields
- `creation_date`
- `last_updated`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `timestamp`

### File Types to Process
- All .json files in recipes/ directory and subdirectories
- Any other JSON files with timestamp metadata

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Mandatory Requirements
- **NO arbitrary timestamps** - must use actual file properties
- **Individual file validation** - each file checked separately
- **Systematic approach** - no skipping or assumptions
- **Detailed commit messages** - traceable changes
- **Complete coverage** - no files missed

### Success Criteria
- All January 2025 timestamps replaced with actual July 2025 file times
- All recipe directories fully processed
- All JSON files with timestamp fields corrected
- No timestamp violations remaining in the codebase

## ISSUES TO WATCH FOR
- Terminal console issues with long commit messages
- Files with duplicate timestamp fields
- Missing directories or unexpected file structures
- Files with different timestamp field names

## HANDOFF NOTES
- Previous agent was asked to prepare handoff due to execution standards
- User emphasized proper archiving and documentation
- Process must be thorough and systematic
- Quality over speed approach required

## NEXT STEPS FOR NEXT AGENT
1. **Start with recipes/01-infrastructure/ subdirectories** (CRITICAL)
2. **Process each directory systematically** using the execution protocol
3. **Commit and push after each batch** with detailed notes
4. **Complete all remaining recipe directories**
5. **Final verification** to ensure no timestamp violations remain
6. **Report completion** with comprehensive summary
